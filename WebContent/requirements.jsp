<h3>Masters Requirements</h3>

<p>
A proficiency examination in Discrete Mathematics is given at the beginning of the first semester of graduate study. Students who fail this examination are required to pass a departmentally approved remedial program.

Computer Science core (13-14 credits): CSI 503 and CSI 518 plus two courses chosen from CSI 500, CSI 508, CSI 509, or CSI 519.  A 3.0 average must be attained in these core courses. Full-time students are expected to complete these courses in the first year, or as soon as possible if undergraduate deficiencies are being made up.

Elective subjects (15 credits): Computer Science courses or courses in other academic departments as approved by the department. Approval of non-departmental electives is based on the individual student's overall academic program and preparation.

Master's Project, Thesis, or Internship (3 credits): Satisfactory completion of (a) any Master's Project course (CSI 68X). The project includes the design and implementation of a computer program of significant scope, unless this is waived by the project faculty supervisor for a student who has sufficient programming experience. The project must include a written report.; (b) CSI 699, Master's Thesis; or  (c) CSI 698, Internship.
